Does the sign of the Doppler here (whether it is added or
subtracted) depend on the mixing sign? In the software receiver
w_if_k=W_FC-w_df_k (signal_tracking.m line 122).

Keep track of the signal phase phi_kp1=phi_k+tau_k*w_df_k as
in signal_tracking.m line 137?
-->This is done inherently by the DDS updating continuously over
   the accumulation period. Instead, need to adjust accumulation
   length (tracking sample count) according to chipping rate to
   allow the accumulation start to line up with the start of the
   C/A code.

Should the sign of the quadrature carrier (sin) be changed
with the mixing sign as in ca_correlator.m line 73?

Carrier lock/bit transition location needs arccos to compute theta (angle between I/Q vectors). Is it possible to either use the FLL/PLL's rotation angle computation (maybe not because of small-angle approximation) or avoid the arccos altogether since you only need to compare abs(theta)<THRESHOLD||abs(theta-pi)<THRESHOLD for carrier lock and abs(theta)>pi/2 for bit extraction. Can the carrier threshold and pi/2 be cast into the cos(theta) space, using some combination of cos(theta) magnitude and sign?
